Hand gestures are a powerful communication medium for Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Despite being widely used, a number of input devices for computer interaction, such as the keyboard, mouse, joystick, and touch screen, are inaccessible to people with impairments. Moreover, in a running car, it is difficult for passengers or the driver to operate using touch-technology. A sound controller that uses hand gestures can be useful in these circumstances. 
In this project, we are developing a sound controller in which we are using hand gestures as the input to control the system. The OpenCV module is used in this implementation to control the gestures. This system uses the web camera to record or capture images /videos and accordingly based on the input, the volume of the system is controlled by this application. We can use our hand gestures to control the basic operation of a computer like increasing and decreasing volume. The system consists of a high-resolution camera to recognize the gesture taken as input by the user. Therefore, people will not have to learn machine-like skills which are a burden most of the time. This type of hand gesture system provides a natural and innovative modern way of non-verbal communication.
